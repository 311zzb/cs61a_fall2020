"""Functions that simulate dice rolls.

A dice function takes no arguments and returns a number from 1 to n
(inclusive), where n is the number of sides on the dice.

Types of dice:

 -  Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
    probability. Examples: four_sided, six_sided

 -  For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice always cycle
    through a fixed sequence of values that are passed as arguments to the
    make_test_dice function.
